# Hi, I'm Lee Talman
I'm a former academic with a background in biomedical engineering & systems biology. After years of simulating infectious diseases, I now build simulations as a Senior Software Engineer at [Engineering Industries eXcellence](https://www.indx.com/).

My interests lie at the intersection of modeling & simulation, software engineering, and data science. I also develop free, open-source utilities for tabletop roleplaying games.
