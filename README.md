# Hi, I'm Lee Talman
I graduated with a **Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering** from the **University of Virginia**. After years of simulating infectious disease biology to create data for machine learning models, I now build software and simulations for military, manufacturing, and agricultural applications as a **Simulation Analyst** at [Engineering Industries eXcellence](https://www.indx.com/). 

My work has always intersected heavily with software engineering and data science. Here's just a sample of the tools I use or have used in the past:

* Languages | *Java, C#/.NET, Python, SQL, Git, R*
* Services | *AWS EC2/S3, Azure DevOp, MS SQL Server, GitHub*
* Data Visualization | *R Shiny, Tableau, Plotly, MATLAB*
* AI/ML Tools | *scikit-learn, PyTorch, keras*

* Simulation Libraries | *[NetLogo](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo), [Repast Simphony](https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony), [SimPy](https://github.com/simpx/simpy)*
* Industry Simulation | *[AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/), [Technomatix Plant Simulation](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/tecnomatix/products/plant-simulation-software/)*
* Engineering & Architecture | *AutoCAD, Revit, Solidworks*
