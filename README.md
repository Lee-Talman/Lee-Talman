# Hi, I'm Lee ðŸ‘‹
I graduated with a **Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering** from the **University of Virginia**. After years of simulating infectious disease biology to create data for machine learning models, I now build simulations for military and manufacturing applications as a **Simulation Analyst** at [Engineering Industries eXcellence](https://www.indx.com/). 

My work has always intersected heavily with software engineering and data science. Here's just a sample of the technologies I've used (my specialities are `highlighted`):

## Software Engineering
* `Python` | *`Django`, Flask*
* `C#` | *ASP.NET, Blazor*
* Java | *JUnit, Spring Boot*
* SQL | *`Microsoft SQL Server`, SSMS*
* Cloud Servers | *AWS, Azure*

## Machine Learning & Data Science
* Data Viz | *`R Shiny`, Tableau, Plotly*
* ML Tools | `scikit-learn`*, PyTorch, keras*

## Simulation & Modeling
* Simulation Libraries | *`NetLogo`, `Repast Simphony`, SimPy*
* Industry Simulation | *`AnyLogic`, `Plant Simulation`*
* Mathematical Modeling | *MATLAB, `R`*
