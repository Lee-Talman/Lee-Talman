# Hi, I'm Lee Talman
I graduated with a **Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering** from the **University of Virginia** in 2022. After years of simulating infectious disease biology, I now build full-stack simulation software for military, manufacturing, and agricultural applications as a Senior Simulation Engineer at [Engineering Industries eXcellence](https://www.indx.com/).

My interests lie at the intersection of modeling & simulation, software engineering, and data science. I also develop free, open-source utilities for tabletop roleplaying games.
