# Hi, I'm Lee Talman
I'm a former academic from the field of computational systems biology. After years of simulating infectious diseases, I now build simulation and machine learning solutions as a Senior Simulation Engineer at [Engineering Industries eXcellence](https://www.indx.com/).

My interests lie at the intersection of modeling & simulation, software engineering, and data science. I also develop free, open-source utilities for tabletop roleplaying games.
