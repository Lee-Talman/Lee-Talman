# Hi, I'm Lee Talman
I graduated with a **Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering** from the **University of Virginia**. After years of simulating infectious disease biology, I now build full-stack simulation software for military, manufacturing, and agricultural applications as a **Senior Simulation Engineer** at [Engineering Industries eXcellence](https://www.indx.com/). 

My work has always intersected heavily with software engineering and data science. Here's just a sample of the tools I use or have used in the past:

* Languages | *C#, Java, Python, SQL, Git, R, Scala, LISP, MATLAB*
* Frameworks | *ASP.NET, Spring, Django, FastAPI*
* Cloud Services | *AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, MongoDB*
* Data Visualization | *R Shiny, Tableau, Plotly, matplotlib, ggplot, seaborn*
* AI/ML Tools | *scikit-learn, PyTorch, keras*

* Simulation Libraries | *[NetLogo](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo), [Repast Simphony](https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony), [SimPy](https://github.com/simpx/simpy)*
* Industrial Simulation | *[AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/), [Technomatix Plant Simulation](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/tecnomatix/products/plant-simulation-software/)*
* Engineering & Architecture | *AutoCAD, Revit, Siemens NX, Solidworks*
